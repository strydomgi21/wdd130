            <p>Hello! My name is Michael Strydom and I am from Durban, South Africa. I love
                the outdoors, especially working at the Durban, South Africa temple. I am a
                qualified horticulturist with 29 years experience. My responsibolities include
                the Johannesburg temple grounds. I pay them a visit every three months or so.
                I have also been to assist at the Kinshasa Temple in the Democratic Republic
                of the Congo. I am really looking forward to the Cape Town temple getting
                constructed and the beautiful landscaping that should take place. I am currently
                working in the capacity of a temple facilities assistant. There sure is a lot of
                work involved in keeping temples running smoothly; a lot of maintenance to carry
                out. We have a lot of beautiful indigenous plants in our country. The Durban temple
                gardens are landscaped after an indigenous, low water requirement style. We have a 
                large open field or veldt grass area on the property. I call it the garden of Eden
                as there are a lot of plants that are bird and butterlfy friendly. You can take a
                walk to the top of "Spyglass Hill" and sit and listen in quiet to the insects,
                frogs and birds going about their business.

            <p>South Africa is a country on the southernmost tip of the African continent, marked by several 
                distinct ecosystems. Inland safari destination Kruger National Park is populated by big game. 
                The Western Cape offers beaches, lush winelands around Stellenbosch and Paarl, craggy cliffs 
                at the Cape of Good Hope, forest and lagoons along the Garden Route, and the city of Cape Town, 
                beneath flat-topped Table Mountain.</p>
